# 3D Simulation of Self-Healing Materials  

üëâ **Try it here: [Live Demo](https://amjuks.github.io/3D-Self-Healing-Compound-Simulation/)**  

This repository showcases a 3D simulation of self-healing materials, built using **React Three Fiber**, to visually represent how molecular bonds break and heal over time. The simulation offers an engaging way to explore the concept of self-healing at a molecular level.  

Inspired by our real-world project on self-healing materials, this tool demonstrates the dynamic process behind materials capable of repairing themselves after sustaining damage.

## üåü Features of the Simulation  

- **Dynamic Hexagonal Grid:**  
  A 3D representation of hexagonal molecules where bonds randomly break and gradually heal.  
- **Customizable Settings:**  
  - Grid dimensions (height, width, depth).  
  - Speed of camera movement and animation.  
  - Duration for breaking and healing bonds.  
  - Percentage of bonds that break.  
  - Camera instability for dramatic effects.  
  - Size of the hexagonal molecules.  
- **Smooth Animations:**  
  The simulation is visually appealing, with seamless animations for bond-breaking and healing.

## üî¨ About the Real-World Project  

This simulation is inspired by our hands-on research on **self-healing materials**.  

- **What are Self-Healing Materials?**  
  These materials mimic biological healing systems, enabling them to autonomously repair micro-damage.  
- **Applications:**  
  They have potential uses in aerospace, construction, electronics, and more, offering enhanced durability and reduced maintenance.  
- **Our Contribution:**  
  As part of our project, we developed a prototype demonstrating self-healing properties in controlled environments, and this simulation serves as a visualization of that concept.
